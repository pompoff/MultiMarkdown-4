	<title>Installer Welcome Message</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>This custom installer will install the <strong>MultiMarkdown</strong> directory into
<code>~/Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown</code>. This directory contains a few
utility scripts and XSLT files that enable use of MultiMarkdown with
<a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a> and adds some additional features when using the <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>
<a href="https://github.com/fletcher/markdown.tmbundle">bundle</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This package will overwrite certain files if you have previously
installed MultiMarkdown 2.0 in your <code>Application Support</code> folder. It will
leave most of the files untouched, but will overwrite some of the core XSLT
files and the core convenience scripts in <code>/bin</code>. You may wish to back that
folder up just in case (or better yet, move it to another location and start
fresh)</p>

<p>This package does <strong>not</strong> include the actual MultiMarkdown binary &#8212; that
requires a separate installer.</p>

<p>For more information, please check out the MultiMarkdown <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">web
site</a>.</p>

<p>You will be guided through the steps necessary to install this software.</p>
